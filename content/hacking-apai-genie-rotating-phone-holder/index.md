Desperate for some new hardware to hack, I came across this 360Â° rotating camera
mount while shopping. It is a bluetooth connected and app controlled phone holder,
meant to be used for face tracking.

All of the smarts are done in the app - featuring tensorflow face model
recognition, tracking, etc.

I, of course, never wanted to use the app - so instead of launching the app, I
copied it to my computer and disassembled it. In this article I will go through
my discoveries about how it communicates with the device.

mobile application, which seems to be developed by a company called "qmxc"
(qmxc.com is referenced all over in their sources.)

Here's a couple of product listings for the device:
